# LuckyAPI v0.2.0

LuckyAPI is a modloader for the indie game [Luck be a Landlord](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1404850/Luck_be_a_Landlord/). It's a really interesting game, go buy it on Steam!
LuckyAPI is heavily based on a [Luckloader](https://github.com/FeldrinH/Luckloader), which I found to be confusing, so I began writing my own modloader. The modloader is in an early state, so don't expect too much out of it just yet.

# Example mod
There is a basic example mod in the `luckyapi` folder. It can be installed like any other mod. The mod is very primitive, as it was mostly used to test LuckyAPI. It doesn't do anything interesting.

My mod, which adds a handful of new symbols, can be found in the `mods` folder of this repository. Feel free to use it as a reference to develop your own mods.
